Whenever I hear people talk about music and musicians I always hear "Their older stuff is better" or "I used to listen to them back when they were good." I have heard different explanations of why a musician's or band's older music is better including "They had more time to work on their first albums" and "That was when they had more control over the production." I wanted to find out if a musician's older music is "better" than there newer music.
